# TODO

## Credits... I think
This is literally `https://github.com/sioodmy/todo` in **cpp** because I wanted to \
Also doesn't have all the functionality though I might add that if I feel like it

## Install
Just download the todo binary

## Build from source
Have g++ installed \
Run the following to create the todo binary
```console
git clone https://github.com/Aayaan-Sahu/todo-complete
cd todo-complete
g++ main.cpp Item.cpp -o todo -std=c++20
```

## Usage
alias it => in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` or whatever, put `alias todo=<FULL-PATH-TO-WHERE-YOU-INSTALLED-IT>`

```console
todo
todo add [...items...]
todo done [...item id's...]
todo remove [...item id's...]
todo arrange
```

## Friendly Warning
The code is horrendous don't look at it
